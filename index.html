    <h1>French prep</h1>
    <p>OK, so now I've spent about an hour setting up this page when I don't really need to. That, I think is procrastination. </p>
    <p>Anyway, the point of this is to keep all of the stuff I collect and learn to prepare for the French exams in one place, accessible at home and work, or anywhere really.</p>
    <p>Part of the point was that I'd be able to use markdown, and hopefully be able to view the pages on the web also. I know that's possible, but I don't get how to get it to work right now...I've committed .md files, but I don't see how they get converted to/rendered as HTML. </p>
    <p>Well, at least I got to try out the Atom editor, which is nice. I love the tab completion for tags, it's even easier than Textmate's. Still a long way from finding a good workflow with it though. In fact, I should at least learn how to commit directly from the editor, I assume that's awesome. </p>
